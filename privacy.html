                                We or third parties on our behalf may use web beacons in combination with cookies on the
                                Services Sites, in our emails or in our advertisements. Web beacons help us understand
                                how visitors interact with the Services Sites and enable us to measure the effectiveness
                                of the Services Sites and our advertising, for example by counting the number of
                                individuals who have visited the Services Sites via a particular advert.

                                A web beacon is typically an electronic image that is placed on a site, email or advert
                                which allows a website to record the simple actions of the user opening the page that
                                contains the beacon. Web beacons provide us with details of how the Services Sites are
                                navigated, how many individuals visit specific pages, the time material was viewed, the
                                types of browsers and computer operating systems used and the Internet Protocol
                                addresses from which you connect to the Services Sites. This is information that is
                                available to any web server you visit and web beacons do not give any extra information
                                away. Web beacons are simply a convenient way of gathering simple statistics and
                                managing cookies and by being able to recognise you this allows us to improve your
                                experience on the Services Sites by enabling us to tailor and personalise your visit.

                                Where web beacons are used in connection with cookies then they may be rendered
                                ineffective by either opting out of the cookies or changing the cookie settings in your
                                browser.
